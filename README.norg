* Norg-rs

norg AST parser that uses tree-sitter-norg internally

#warn
> This version of parser uses unofficial norg spec

note about macro system:

- all macros all universally called "tag" now. A term "macro" is left to be used for future in-parsing macro expansion system
- every tags will be expanded to `Vec<Self>`.
- expanded tag contents can include tags. there will be recursion limit for this

** Exporting:

~ parse whole document as AST
~ walk through AST and run `neorg/export/block`. `neorg/export/block` will run `((block :export) target ctx)` for `Block::Embed` types.

@code
Text -(rust)-> Vec<Block> -(janet)-> Other spec
@end

** Usage

> Not possible right now. This is a plan.

- embed `stdlib.janet` in your project
- override some export logics in janet
- run `(norg/export lang blocks ctx)`

** TODOs

- (x) marshal janet to an image and provide api to embed in rust binary
- (x) pass janet result to rust
- (x) test janet exporter as single rust binary
- ( ) method to override the existing export logic (not adding new one like tags)
- ( ) api to resolve links
- ( ) embed `stdlib.janet` into rust
- ( ) package as rust crate
